        <section class="about">
            Logan Ploss is a student at the Crane School of Music, SUNY Potsdam, 
            class 2025, with a major in music business and a concentration in voice. 
            He is a member of the vocal studio of Dr Donald George, tenor, and receives 
            private lessons. As a music business student, Logan also learns to manage the 
            operations of his original band called PINS, (People In Need of Supervision) 
            as they influence the music scene of Potsdam, NY. 

            Logan began as a guitarist in 2018 when he took lessons from Kenny Hohman, 
            owner of Troy Music Academy and guitarist of the Troy native band Super 400. 
            Through taking lessons at Troy Music Academy, Logan had the chance to have 
            recital performances with other students. Most notably, Logan led the band for 
            the Beatles rooftop concert tribute in 2019.

            Logan Ploss started performing on his own after releasing an album of original 
            music on February 1st, 2021 called Century Ride. In tandem with the release, 
            Logan performed original sets at local coffee shops to promote the project. 
            Starting school in the fall of 2021, Logan continued to write and perform new 
            songs at the school's nightclub Hurleys. 

            Logan formed the band PINS in the fall of 2022, with bassist Jacob Sullivan, 
            and drummer Vatressa Teamoh. The band performs a mixture of covers and original 
            material and has gigged since its inception. PINS has performed a headlining 
            set at Hurleys nightclub, is two time champ of Potsdam's annual battle of the 
            bands competition (Battle of the Bands 2022, Battle of the Bands 2023), and has 
            performed house sets in town to spread their influence beyond the campus.

                Logan Ploss is the lead guitarist and vocalist of the group. Logan 
                grew up in the capital region of New York, and started playing the 
                trombone as his first instrument. He draws inspiration from other 
                prolific guitarists and songwriters, namely Elliot Smith, Jimi Hendrix, 
                and Johnny Greenwood.

            <p class="jacob">
                Jacob Sullivan is a profuse(?) instrumentalist that is well-versed 
                with multiple instruments (i think). However, his bass lines will
                have you dancing before you realize. He is originally
                from LOCATION and is majoring in MAJOR.

            <p class="vatressa">
                Vatressa Teamoh is an incredible drummer, and has a pocket that leaves the 
                listener awe-struck at how funky she is. She is originally from LOCATION and 
                is majoring in MAJOR.
