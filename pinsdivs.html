                Logan Ploss is the lead guitarist and vocalist of the group. Logan 
                grew up in the capital region of New York, and started playing the 
                trombone as his first instrument. He draws inspiration from other 
                prolific guitarists and songwriters, namely Elliot Smith, Jimi Hendrix, 
                and Johnny Greenwood.

                Jacob Sullivan is a profuse(?) instrumentalist that is well-versed 
                with multiple instruments (i think). However, his bass lines will
                have you dancing before you realize. He is originally
                from LOCATION and is majoring in MAJOR.

                Vatressa Teamoh is an incredible drummer, and has a pocket that leaves the 
                listener awe-struck at how funky she is. She is originally from LOCATION and 
                is majoring in MAJOR.
